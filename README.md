templateR
=========

Project template for data analysis in R.


Setting it up:

* replace TEMPLATE by your project name
* place data in subdirectory data


What it does for you: 

* opening the R project will run the commands in .Rprofile, storing the home directory of the project --- useful when running codes at different sites (or just in different directories)

TBD

* write little shell script (or R??) that replaces TEMPLATE everywhere and generates new project...
